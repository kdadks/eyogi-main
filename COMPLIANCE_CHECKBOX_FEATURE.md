# Compliance Checkbox Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a checkbox feature for compliance items that allows users to mark items as complete. When checked, a submission is created with status "submitted" and awaits admin approval. The compliance progress bar only updates when admin approves the submission.

## Changes Made

### 1. **API Layer** (`src/SSH/src/lib/api/compliance.ts`)

#### New Function: `markComplianceAsComplete`
```typescript
export async function markComplianceAsComplete(
  complianceItemId: string,
  userId: string,
): Promise<ComplianceSubmission>
```

**Features:**
- Creates a submission with minimal data when user checks the checkbox
- Checks for existing submissions to prevent duplicates
- Sets status to "submitted" (pending admin review)
- Creates notification for admins about the completion
- Form data includes `{ checkbox_completed: true }` to identify checkbox submissions

**Workflow:**
1. User clicks checkbox on compliance item
2. System creates submission with status "submitted"
3. Notification is sent to admin
4. Admin reviews in Compliance Management panel
5. Upon approval, status changes to "approved" and progress bar updates

### 2. **Compliance Checklist Component** (`src/SSH/src/components/compliance/ComplianceChecklist.tsx`)

#### Added Checkbox UI
- Added checkbox at the beginning of each compliance item card
- Checkbox shows checked state for "submitted" or "approved" items
- Checkbox is disabled once item is submitted or approved

#### Visual States:
- **Unchecked (Pending)**: White background, clickable
- **Checked (Submitted)**: Blue background, disabled - awaiting admin review
- **Checked (Approved)**: Green background, disabled - admin approved

#### New Handler: `handleCheckboxChange`
```typescript
const handleCheckboxChange = async (item: ComplianceChecklistItem) => {
  // Prevents unchecking submitted/approved items
  // Calls markComplianceAsComplete API
  // Shows success toast with admin review message
  // Reloads compliance data
}
```

#### Toast Message
When checkbox is clicked:
```
"Thank you for completing this compliance item. Admin will check and provide confirmation."
```

#### Updated `handleItemClick`
- Now accepts optional event parameter
- Prevents opening form modal when clicking checkbox
- Preserves existing form submission functionality

### 3. **Admin Compliance Management** (`src/SSH/src/components/admin/ComplianceManagement.tsx`)

#### New Component: `SubmissionsTab`
Comprehensive submission review interface with:

**Filter Tabs:**
- All submissions
- Pending (submitted - awaiting review)
- Approved
- Rejected

**Submission Card Features:**
- Displays compliance item title
- Shows user information
- Displays submission timestamp
- Shows form data details (including checkbox_completed)
- Status badge with color coding
- Rejection reason display (if rejected)
- Review timestamp and reviewer info

**Admin Actions:**
- **Approve Button**: Green button with check icon
- **Reject Button**: Red button with warning icon
- Both only shown for "submitted" status items

#### Review Modal
- Approve confirmation with single click
- Reject requires mandatory reason textarea
- Processing state with spinner
- Success/error toast notifications

**Review Process:**
1. Admin clicks Approve or Reject button
2. Modal opens for confirmation
3. If rejecting, reason is mandatory
4. On confirm, `reviewComplianceSubmission` API is called
5. Status updates to "approved" or "rejected"
6. User receives notification
7. Progress bar updates only on approval

### 4. **Required Badge Styling** (`src/SSH/src/components/compliance/ComplianceChecklist.tsx`)

Updated the "Required" badge to be smaller and rectangular:
```tsx
<Badge 
  size="sm"
  className={`rounded-sm ${is_mandatory ? 'bg-red-100 text-red-800' : 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-800'}`}
>
  {is_mandatory ? 'Required' : 'Pending'}
</Badge>
```

**Changes:**
- Added `size="sm"` prop (smaller text and padding)
- Changed from `rounded-full` to `rounded-sm` (small rounded corners)
- Rectangular button-like appearance

### 5. **Quick Actions Section Removed**

Removed the entire Quick Actions card from:
- `DashboardComplianceSection.tsx`
- Cleaned up `ComplianceQuickActions` function
- Removed unused `ChartBarIcon` import

## User Workflow

### For Teachers/Users:
1. Navigate to Dashboard → Profile → Compliance Center
2. See list of compliance items with checkboxes
3. Click checkbox to mark item as complete
4. See toast: "Thank you for completing this compliance item. Admin will check and provide confirmation."
5. Checkbox becomes checked with blue background (submitted state)
6. Wait for admin approval
7. Once approved, checkbox shows green background and progress bar updates

### For Admins:
1. Navigate to Admin → Compliance Management
2. Click "Submissions" tab
3. See pending reviews with count badge
4. Review submission details and form data
5. Click "Approve" or "Reject"
6. If rejecting, provide mandatory reason
7. Confirm action
8. User receives notification of decision
9. Progress bars update automatically
