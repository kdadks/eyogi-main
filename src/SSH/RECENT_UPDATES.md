### 4. Enhanced Console Log Removal
**Issue**: Console logs still appearing in production despite initial configuration

**File**: `src/SSH/vite.config.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- ‚úÖ Changed minify from boolean to `'terser'`

- Double-layer protection (esbuild + terser)

**Impact**:
- All console logs removed in production builds
- No sensitive information exposed
