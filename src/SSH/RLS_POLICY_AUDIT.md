# RLS Policy Audit Results

## Current State (October 11, 2025)

### Summary

Your Supabase database already had RLS policies in place! Our script successfully added **new standardized policies** alongside the existing ones. However, this has created **duplicate policies** on some tables.

## Tables with RLS Enabled

### ✅ Compliance Tables (4 tables)
- `profiles` - ✅ RLS enabled, **11 old + 6 new = 17 policies** (duplicates!)
- `compliance_items` - ✅ RLS enabled, **2 old + 6 new = 8 policies** (duplicates!)
- `compliance_submissions` - ✅ RLS enabled, **4 old + 6 new = 10 policies** (duplicates!)
- `compliance_notifications` - ✅ RLS enabled, **4 old + 6 new = 10 policies** (duplicates!)

### ✅ Other Tables with Existing Policies
- `compliance_files` - ✅ 3 policies (good, keep as is)
- `compliance_forms` - ✅ 2 policies (good, keep as is)
- `user_compliance_status` - ✅ 3 policies (good, keep as is)
- `child_achievements` - ✅ 1 policy
- `child_assignments` - ✅ 1 policy
- `child_certificates` - ✅ 1 policy
- `child_enrollments` - ✅ 1 policy
- `child_learning_activities` - ✅ 1 policy
- `child_study_sessions` - ✅ 1 policy
- `course_assignments` - ✅ 3 policies
- `courses` - ✅ 2 policies
- `enrollments` - ✅ 3 policies
- `media_files` - ✅ 6 policies
- `parent_child_relationships` - ✅ 1 policy

## Issue: Duplicate Policies

The following tables have **duplicate policies** (old + new):

### 1. profiles (17 total policies)
**Old policies to remove:**
- "Admins can read all profiles"
- "Allow anonymous email check for signup"
- "Enable all for service role"
- "Enable insert for auth users"
- "Enable insert for website users"
- "Enable read for own profile"
- "Enable update for own profile"
- "Users can insert own profile"
- "Users can read own profile"
- "Users can update own profile"
- "Users can view own profile"

**New policies to keep:**
- `profiles_service_role_all`
- `profiles_admin_all`
- `profiles_authenticated_read`
- `profiles_authenticated_insert`
- `profiles_authenticated_update`
- `profiles_authenticated_delete`

### 2. compliance_items (8 total policies)
**Old policies to remove:**
- "Compliance items are viewable by all authenticated users"
- "Only admins can manage compliance items"

**New policies to keep:**
- `compliance_items_service_role_all`
- `compliance_items_admin_all`
- `compliance_items_authenticated_read`
- `compliance_items_authenticated_insert`
- `compliance_items_authenticated_update`
- `compliance_items_authenticated_delete`

### 3. compliance_submissions (10 total policies)
**Old policies to remove:**
- "Admins can view and manage all submissions"
- "Users can create their own submissions"
- "Users can update their own pending submissions"
- "Users can view their own submissions"

**New policies to keep:**
- `compliance_submissions_service_role_all`
- `compliance_submissions_authenticated_read`
- `compliance_submissions_authenticated_insert`
- `compliance_submissions_authenticated_update`
- `compliance_submissions_authenticated_delete`

### 4. compliance_notifications (10 total policies)
**Old policies to remove:**
- "Admins can manage all notifications"
- "System can create notifications"
- "Users can update their own notifications"
- "Users can view their own notifications"

**New policies to keep:**
- `compliance_notifications_service_role_all`
- `compliance_notifications_authenticated_read`
- `compliance_notifications_authenticated_insert`
- `compliance_notifications_authenticated_update`
- `compliance_notifications_authenticated_delete`

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ Positive: Everything Still Works
- Having duplicate policies doesn't break functionality
- Both old and new policies are **permissive** (not restrictive)
- Service role key still bypasses all policies
- Backend operations continue to work

### ⚠️ Issues with Duplicates
- **Confusion**: Hard to understand which policy does what
- **Maintenance**: Updates need to be made in multiple places
- **Performance**: Slight overhead checking multiple policies
- **Conflicts**: Potential for future policy conflicts

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Clean Up Duplicates (Recommended)

Execute the cleanup script to remove old policies:

```sql
-- Execute this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: src/SSH/migrations/cleanup_duplicate_rls_policies.sql
```

This will:
- ✅ Remove 11 old policies from `profiles`
- ✅ Remove 2 old policies from `compliance_items`
- ✅ Remove 4 old policies from `compliance_submissions`
- ✅ Remove 4 old policies from `compliance_notifications`
- ✅ Keep the new standardized policies

### Option 2: Keep Both (Not Recommended)

If you want to keep existing policies:
- Document which policies are active
- Ensure no conflicts between old and new policies
- Plan to consolidate in the future

### Option 3: Rollback New Policies (If Issues)

If the new policies cause problems:
```sql
-- Remove only the new policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_service_role_all" ON public.profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_admin_all" ON public.profiles;
-- ... etc
```

## Testing Checklist

After cleanup, verify:

### Backend (Service Role)
- [ ] Compliance submission creation works
- [ ] Admin dashboard loads all data
- [ ] Notifications are created successfully
- [ ] File uploads work

### Frontend (Regular User)
- [ ] User can view own profile
- [ ] User can view own submissions
- [ ] User can submit compliance items
- [ ] User cannot see other users' data

### Frontend (Admin User)
- [ ] Admin can view all profiles
- [ ] Admin can manage compliance items
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows all data
- [ ] Admin can review submissions

## Policy Naming Convention

Our new standardized policies follow this pattern:

```
{table_name}_{role}_{operation}

Examples:
- profiles_service_role_all
- compliance_items_admin_all
- compliance_submissions_authenticated_read
- compliance_notifications_authenticated_update
```

Benefits:
- ✅ Clear and consistent
- ✅ Easy to identify table and operation
- ✅ Searchable and maintainable

## Next Steps

1. **Review** the cleanup script: `cleanup_duplicate_rls_policies.sql`
2. **Backup** your database (recommended before any schema changes)
3. **Execute** the cleanup script in Supabase SQL Editor
4. **Verify** with the query at the end of the cleanup script
5. **Test** your application thoroughly

## Files Created

- ✅ `migrations/enable_rls_all_tables.sql` - New RLS policies
- ✅ `migrations/cleanup_duplicate_rls_policies.sql` - Cleanup script
- ✅ `RLS_POLICY_AUDIT.md` - This document
- ✅ `scripts/check-table-columns.ts` - Column verification script

## Conclusion

Your database security is in good shape! The existing policies were already protecting your data. Our new standardized policies add:

- ✅ Consistent naming convention
- ✅ Service role bypass documentation
- ✅ Admin-specific policies
- ✅ Comprehensive CRUD policies

**Recommendation:** Execute the cleanup script to remove duplicates and maintain a clean, standardized policy set.
