## 🛠 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the SQL migration to create the necessary tables:

```sql
-- Execute the compliance_schema.sql file in your Supabase SQL editor
-- This creates all tables, indexes, RLS policies, and sample data
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure your Supabase configuration is set up with the following environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 3. Component Integration

#### Admin Dashboard Integration

```tsx
import ComplianceManagement from '../components/admin/ComplianceManagement'

// In your admin dashboard
<ComplianceManagement />
```

#### User Dashboard Integration

```tsx
import DashboardComplianceSection from '../components/compliance/DashboardComplianceSection'

// In user dashboard (full view)
<DashboardComplianceSection 
  userId={user.id}
  userRole={user.role} // 'teacher' | 'parent' | 'student'
  showNotifications={true}
/>

// In user dashboard (compact view)
<DashboardComplianceSection 
  userId={user.id}
  userRole={user.role}
  compactView={true}
/>
```

#### Standalone Components

```tsx
// Compliance checklist only
<ComplianceChecklist userId={user.id} userRole={user.role} />

// Notifications only
<ComplianceNotifications userId={user.id} />

// Welcome message
<ComplianceWelcomeMessage userRole={user.role} />
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Tables

1. **compliance_items** - Stores compliance requirements
2. **compliance_forms** - Dynamic form definitions
3. **compliance_submissions** - User form submissions
4. **compliance_files** - Uploaded file metadata
5. **user_compliance_status** - User progress tracking
6. **compliance_notifications** - System notifications

### Key Relationships

- Compliance items can have associated forms
- Forms contain dynamic field definitions in JSONB format
- Submissions link users to compliance items and forms
- Files are associated with specific form submissions
- Status tracks user progress for each compliance item

## 🔐 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins have full access to manage compliance system
- Service role can create notifications and update status

### File Upload Security
- 2MB file size limit
- Type validation for uploaded files
- Secure storage in Supabase Storage
- Access control through RLS policies

### Data Validation
- Form validation on frontend and backend
- Required field enforcement
- Custom validation rules per field type
- Safe handling of user input

## 🎨 UI Components

### Design System
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Heroicons** for consistent iconography
- **React Hot Toast** for notifications

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Accessible color schemes and contrasts

### User Experience
