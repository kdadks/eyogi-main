# RLS (Row Level Security) Setup Complete ✅

## What Was Created

This project now includes a complete RLS configuration system for the Supabase database.

```

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Check Current Status

```bash
cd src/SSH
npm run rls:check
```

This will show which tables currently have RLS enabled/disabled.

### Step 2: Review Generated SQL

The SQL script has already been generated at:
```
src/SSH/migrations/enable_rls_all_tables.sql
```

Open and review it to understand what will be applied.

### Step 3: Execute in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open `migrations/enable_rls_all_tables.sql`
4. Copy the entire contents
5. Paste into SQL Editor
6. Click **Run**

### Step 4: Verify

```bash
npm run rls:check
```

All tables should now show RLS as enabled.

### Step 5: Test Your Application

- ✅ Test backend operations (should work unchanged)
- ✅ Test frontend with regular user
- ✅ Test frontend with admin user

## NPM Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run rls:check` | Check current RLS status of all tables |
| `npm run rls:generate` | Regenerate the RLS SQL script |
| `npm run rls:help` | Display quick start guide |

## What RLS Does

### Before RLS
- Any authenticated user could potentially query any table
- Security relied solely on application code
- Risk of data leakage if bugs exist

### After RLS
- 🔒 Database enforces access rules
- 👤 Users see only their own data
- 👑 Admins have elevated access
- 🛡️ Service role bypasses all restrictions (backend safe)

## Tables Protected (12)

| Table | Access Pattern |
|-------|----------------|
| `profiles` | Users see only their profile |
| `compliance_items` | All authenticated users (read-only) |
| `compliance_submissions` | Users see only their submissions |
| `compliance_notifications` | Users see only their notifications |
| `compliance_files` | Users see only their files |
| `user_compliance_status` | Users see only their status |
| `children` | Parents see only their children |
| `class_assignments` | Users see only their assignments |
| `classes` | Teachers see only their classes |
| `attendance` | All authenticated users (read-only) |
| `attendance_records` | Users see records they created |
| `teacher_dashboard_stats` | Teachers see only their stats |

## Policy Types

### 1. Service Role Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "table_service_role_all" ON public.table_name
  FOR ALL TO service_role
  USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
```
**Purpose:** Allows backend to bypass RLS completely

### 2. Admin Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "table_admin_all" ON public.table_name
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );
```
**Purpose:** Gives admins full access to all records

### 3. User Policies
```sql
-- Users can read their own records
CREATE POLICY "table_authenticated_read" ON public.table_name
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Users can insert their own records
CREATE POLICY "table_authenticated_insert" ON public.table_name
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- ... UPDATE and DELETE policies follow same pattern
```
**Purpose:** Restricts users to their own data

## Critical Information

### ✅ Your Backend is Safe

The **service role key** used in your backend automatically bypasses ALL RLS policies:

```typescript
// Backend code - NOT affected by RLS
import { supabaseAdmin } from '@/lib/supabase'

// This works exactly as before
const { data } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('compliance_submissions')
  .select('*')  // Returns ALL submissions
```

### ⚠️ Frontend is Restricted

Frontend code using the anon/auth key respects RLS:

```typescript
// Frontend code - AFFECTED by RLS
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase'

// This only returns user's own submissions
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('compliance_submissions')
  .select('*')  // Returns ONLY user's submissions
```

## Testing Checklist

After enabling RLS, verify:

### Backend Tests
- [ ] Compliance submissions can be created
- [ ] Admin dashboard loads all data
- [ ] Background jobs work
- [ ] Batch operations succeed

### Frontend Tests (Regular User)
- [ ] Can view own profile
- [ ] Can view own submissions
- [ ] Cannot see other users' data
- [ ] Can submit new items

### Frontend Tests (Admin)
- [ ] Can view all profiles
- [ ] Can review all submissions
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows everything
- [ ] Can manage all records

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot read from table"

**Solution:** Ensure you're using the service role key:
```typescript
import { supabaseAdmin } from '@/lib/supabase'  // ✅ Correct
// not
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase'  // ❌ Wrong for backend
```

### Problem: "Row violates row-level security policy"

**Cause:** User trying to access data they don't own

**Solutions:**
1. Check if user is authenticated
2. Verify the user_id matches auth.uid()
3. Ensure admin users have role = 'admin' in profiles

### Problem: Need to customize policies

**Solution:** Edit `generate-rls-script.ts`:
1. Modify the `SSH_TABLES` array
2. Regenerate: `npm run rls:generate`
3. Review the new SQL file
4. Execute in Supabase

## Rollback

If you need to disable RLS on a table:

```sql
-- Disable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.table_name DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "table_service_role_all" ON public.table_name;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "table_admin_all" ON public.table_name;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "table_authenticated_read" ON public.table_name;
-- ... etc
```
