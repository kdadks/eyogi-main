# 🚀 Admin Console Setup & Testing Guide

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Environment Setup
Copy the environment variables from your main project:
```bash
# Create .env file in src/SSH/ directory
cp .env.local.example .env

# Add your actual Supabase credentials:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key  
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### 2. Database Setup (Already Done ✅)
- ✅ SQL schema applied
- ✅ Authenticated user created
- ✅ RLS bypassed with service role key

### 3. Test Admin Login
```bash
# Start the admin console
cd "d:\ITWala Projects\eyogi-main\src\SSH"
npm run dev

# Open browser to: http://localhost:5174
# Login with your Supabase auth user credentials
```

## 🎯 What's Working Now

### ✅ Phase 1 Complete
- **Admin Authentication**: Service role authentication with RLS bypass
- **Dashboard Layout**: Responsive sidebar, header, and main content area
- **User Management**: Complete user listing, filtering, and basic CRUD operations
- **Role-Based Access**: Permission system for different admin roles
- **Real-time Data**: Direct Supabase integration with live data

### 🔧 Admin Console Features
1. **Login System**: Secure authentication with role validation
2. **Dashboard**: Live statistics and quick actions
3. **User Management**: 
   - View all users (students, teachers, admins)
   - Search and filter by role/status
   - User creation/editing (modal ready)
   - Role assignment and status management
4. **Navigation**: Role-based sidebar with permission filtering
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Login Testing
- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost:5174
- [ ] Should redirect to `/admin/login`
- [ ] Enter your Supabase auth credentials
- [ ] Should redirect to admin dashboard on success
- [ ] Verify role-based access (admin/super_admin only)

### Dashboard Testing  
- [ ] View dashboard statistics (users, courses, etc.)
- [ ] Check quick action buttons
- [ ] Verify sidebar navigation works
- [ ] Test mobile responsive menu

### User Management Testing
- [ ] Click "Users" in sidebar
- [ ] Verify user list loads from database
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test role and status filtering
- [ ] Try editing a user (modal should open)
- [ ] Verify delete confirmation works

## 🔄 Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **User Creation Form**: Complete modal with form validation
2. **Course Management**: Full course CRUD interface  
3. **Enrollment System**: Approval workflow and tracking
4. **Bulk Operations**: Mass user/enrollment management
5. **Advanced Filters**: Date ranges, custom queries

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Cannot connect to Supabase**: Check .env file has correct credentials
2. **RLS errors**: Ensure service role key is configured
3. **Login fails**: Verify user exists in Supabase Auth
4. **Permission denied**: Check user role in profiles table

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $VITE_SUPABASE_URL

# Check network requests in browser dev tools
# Check Supabase logs for authentication errors

# Verify user role in database:
# SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```
